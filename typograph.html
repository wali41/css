    <p class="text">Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and visually
    appealing. It’s more than just picking a cool font—it’s about how letters and words are placed to create mood, convey
    meaning, and guide the reader's eye. Whether it’s in a poster, website, or a book, good typography sets the tone before
    a single word is even read. From bold headlines that scream attention to elegant serifs that whisper sophistication,
    typography is the silent powerhouse of design.</p>
